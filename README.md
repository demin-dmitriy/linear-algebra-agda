This repository is work in progress formalization of finite dimensional linear algebra using
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) proof assistant and [1] book as the
main reference.

The [1] book consists of two parts. The goal of this project is to formally proof most of the
statements from the first part which covers linear algebra. Second part of the book
covers calculus for functions of several variables and will be completely ignored.
